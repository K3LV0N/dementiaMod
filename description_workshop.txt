[h1]Dementia Mod[/h1]

This mod gives you [b]dementia[b]!

Over time, your character will gradually forget things:
[list]
	[*]Items in their inventory
	[*]How much items cost
	[*]What boss summons you have (with cross-mod support!)
[/list]

Don’t worry, it’s not permanent — just die and you’ll be all good again!
